## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes using machine learning techniques.  
Early prediction of heart disease can help doctors take preventive measures and improve patient care.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Heart Disease Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and maximum heart rate.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  

These metrics help understand the model’s performance, especially for medical diagnosis where false negatives are critical.

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection  
4. Model training  
5. Model evaluation  
6. Result comparison
